# CMSE202-Honors-Project


A file that includes different factors about a insurance holder and the amount charged to that insurance holder was used to determine which factors affect the insurance charges the most. Then it was used to create a model that can predict how much the insurance charges would be for a person with the different factors given. A class was created to hold the differect factors of each insurance holder and then uses the model to calculate what the insurance charges would be for that insurance holder with those factors.

To use the code in the Honors Project notebook, the cells should be run in order. Different plots will be made to show how the different factors affect insurance charges. The InsuranceHolder class should be run before any objects are created. The first model is created and the second model is created after removing factors that are not significant to the model. The model is tested multiple times using different amounts for the difference between the actual and predicted values. Then you can use the class to create different insurance holders with different attributes to determine what their insurance charges would be.
